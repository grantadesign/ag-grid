            <h1>Our Mission</h1>

            <p class="lead">
                At ag-Grid, our mission is simple: <strong>Build the best datagrid in the world</strong>.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Born out of frustration with existing solutions, <strong>ag-Grid</strong> evolved from a side project to becoming the leading JavaScript datagrid on the market. We are a company built by developers for developers, and - true to our roots - we offer <strong>ag-Grid Community</strong>: a free and open-source project that delivers world class grid performance. <strong>ag-Grid Enterprise</strong> is our commercially-licensed offering which has enjoyed widespread adoption and facilitates us to keep delivering on our mission.
            </p>

            <p>    
                Our story is proof that necessity is the mother of invention. During his time working in London-based financial institutions, <strong>Niall Crosby</strong> - founder and CEO - struggled to find any datagrid component that could deliver the performance required in tandem with a complete feature list. This struggle ultimately led Niall to pulling out the keyboard one Christmas holiday period and starting <strong>ag-Grid</strong> as a side project. This was then released as open source and quickly developed a following. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Niall found himself having to devote considerable time and effort to maintaining <strong>ag-Grid</strong>, even fielding feature requests from users. It became apparent that this thing had legs - and the idea of <strong>ag-Grid Enterprise</strong> took seed in Niall’s mind. Fast forward to March 2016 and the first commercial version was launched.
            </p>

            <p>
                Today, <strong>ag-Grid</strong> is a self-funded, bootstrapped company with over 1,500 customers in 65 countries. Our product has resonated in the market - as our users face the same challenges Niall did - and this has been central to our rapid growth. And we’re not stopping here: we are working on the next great features to continue our mission.
            </p>

            <h2> Our Principles</h2>

            <p>We believe that a datagrid should be agnostic to the framework that developers choose. This allows flexibility and future-proofs your development. This is also where the 'ag' in <strong>ag-Grid</strong> comes from.  </p>

            <p>Our experience is in building Enterprise applications: we know that the datagrid is at the core of an Enterprise application, and needs to deliver performance and a rich feature set.  </p>

            <p>We give away what others charge for. <strong>ag-Grid Community</strong> provides all of the features of our competition. We only charge when we go above and beyond, with features that other grids don’t provide.  </p>
