    <h1 class="first-h1">ag-Grid: Built for Angular</h1>
    
    <p class="lead">
        ag-Grid began life as an Angular grid. In fact, the first incarnation of the grid was AngularGrid. We have since added support for other frameworks. This means is we integrate seamlessly with Angular 2+. We also have a close working relationship with the Angular team so support the latest versions as they're released. This page outlines our products, the key benefits and features as well as the pathway to get up and running quickly. With these resources, you can quickly add a datgrid or datatable to your Angular application.
