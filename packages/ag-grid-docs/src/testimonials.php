        At ag-Grid, we love what we are doing. What does matter though is that our users love it, too.

    <blockquote>
        <p>We’re using ag-Grid as a major component in our enterprise analytics and reporting product and it’s incredible. Prior to ag-Grid, we tried jqGrid, jqxGrid, DataTables, and SlickGrid, which all have their strong points, but we eventually ran into a wall with certain features. ag-Grid’s grouping, aggregation, filtering, and all-around flexibility allowed us to quickly integrate it into our product. And, the performance is truly awesome!</p>

        <p>I'm so glad you made ag-Grid!  Finally, someone has done it right.  I started using Google's Table visualizations, then tried dataTables.net and then js-Grid before I discovered your product.  Your design and implementation is brilliant.</p>

        <p>ag-Grid is one of the best Grids I have ever worked with. In spite of being feature rich it is still one of the fastest grids I have ever used. This grid will be an essential part of my tool kit especially when working with extremely large datasets.</p>
